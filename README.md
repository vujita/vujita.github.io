#I am hosting my site via github pages

This lets me do a few things

- It will be viewable on my personal [domain](http://vubnguyen.com), via some dns mapping
- Keep my deployment quick and painless
- Let me leverage github for hosting and source control
- Share my code!!!

There is a downside, since I did this as a user page.  The master branch is always gets published, so my distribution is somewhat contanimated by other build files. 
I may move this to a project to fix this at another point.
